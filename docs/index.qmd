# Geospatial Analytics Lab 

Welcome to my Digital Geospatial Research Lab! The idea behind my personal geospatial and geostatistical analytics lab is to use open-source data and standard mapping tools, as well as applying machine learning algorithms and analytics, to uncover new information about human activity, nature and market dynamics around the globe.

## Projects

- [Isochrone Calculator](isochrones.qmd)  
  Compute travel-time catchment areas from an origin over a street network.

- [Population Reach Analysis](mexico-population-reach.qmd)  
  An analysis of how the population is distributed across urban communities in Mexico, and how much of this population can be covered by a 15 minutes isochrone by selecting strategic points. 

## Theory Notes

Some background notes that support the projects:

In the [Data Hacks](data_hacks.qmd) page, we can review some useful scripts and links into public repositories and open data sources related with geo spatial data.
